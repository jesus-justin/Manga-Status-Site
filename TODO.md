# Site Loading and Code Cleanup Plan

## Database and Connection Issues

## Design Preservation
- [ ] Ensure all design elements (particles, animations, themes) are preserved
- [ ] Keep responsive design and accessibility features
- [ ] Maintain loading indicators and user feedback elements
- [ ] Preserve SweetAlert integrations and form validations

## Error Handling and Debugging
