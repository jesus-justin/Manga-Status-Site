# Optimization Plan to Prevent Crashes and Improve Performance

## Critical Fixes to Prevent Crashes
- [x] Add pagination to browse.php to prevent loading all manga at once
- [ ] Fix stats calculation in home.php to be server-side and accurate
- [ ] Add comprehensive error handling with try-catch blocks
- [ ] Add memory and timeout limits for large data processing
- [ ] Optimize database queries with proper indexes

## Performance Enhancements
- [ ] Implement query result limits to prevent memory exhaustion
- [ ] Optimize JavaScript loading and execution
- [ ] Add lazy loading for images (already partially implemented)
- [ ] Minimize CSS and JS files

## Code Quality Improvements
- [ ] Refactor large inline PHP blocks for better readability
- [ ] Add input validation and sanitization
- [ ] Improve error messages and user feedback
- [ ] Add loading indicators for better UX

## Database Optimizations
- [ ] Apply indexes from database_optimizations.sql
- [ ] Optimize query structures for better performance
- [ ] Add query execution time monitoring

## Testing and Validation
- [ ] Test with large datasets to ensure stability
- [ ] Validate all optimizations work correctly
- [ ] Monitor memory usage and performance metrics
